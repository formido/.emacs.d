INTRODUCTION 
------------

Just my personal .emacs and associated lisp packages. Since I switch
between computers and platforms a lot, I need an efficient way to
maintain my environment.

INSTALLATION 
------------

1. Checkout repository somewhere onto my machine.  
2. 'cd' into the directory with INSTALL.sh.  
3. If I'm not me then don't do the next step, since this .emacs
   probably only makes sense for me.  
4. Run INSTALL.sh, taking care to understand it's going to nuke the 
   .emacs and .emacs.d that's already there.

ISSUES 
------

None.

TODO 
----

 * Move third party packages into subdirectory[1]
 * Start adding some of the cool stuff I've seen around[1]
 * Add write hook to compile elisp packages[1]
 * Add keybinding, mouse, and macros to separate file?[1]
 * Change everything to autoload and eval-after-load[1]
 * Test for code dependencies (non-lisp) availability[2]
