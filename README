INTRODUCTION
------------

Just my personal .emacs and associated lisp packages. Since I switch between computers and platforms a lot, I need an efficient way to maintain my environment.

INSTALLATION
------------

1. Checkout repository somewhere onto my machine.
2. 'cd' into the directory with INSTALL.sh.
3. If I'm not me then don't do the next step, since this .emacs probably only makes sense for me.
4. Run INSTALL.sh, taking care to understand it's going to nuke the .emacs and .emacs.d that's already there.

ISSUES
------

None.

TODO
----

 * Move third party packages into subdirectory (http://www.emacsblog.org/2007/10/07/declaring-emacs-bankruptcy/)
 * Split up platform dependent customizations (http://www.emacsblog.org/2007/10/07/declaring-emacs-bankruptcy/)
 * Start adding some of the cool stuff I've seen around (http://www.emacsblog.org/2007/10/07/declaring-emacs-bankruptcy/)
 * Installer compiles lisp packages (or add write hook to do this?) (http://www.emacsblog.org/2007/10/07/declaring-emacs-bankruptcy/)
 * Add keybinding, mouse, and macros to separate file? (http://www.emacsblog.org/2007/10/07/declaring-emacs-bankruptcy/)
 * Change everything to autoload and eval-after-load (http://www.emacsblog.org/2007/10/07/declaring-emacs-bankruptcy/)
 * Switch to a symlink for .emacs? (http://www.emacsblog.org/2007/10/07/declaring-emacs-bankruptcy/)
 * Test for code dependencies (non-lisp) availability (http://www.dotemacs.de/recovery.html)
