INTRODUCTION
------------

Just my personal .emacs and associated lisp packages. Since I switch between computers and platforms a lot, I need an efficient way to maintain my environment.

INSTALLATION
------------

1. Checkout repository somewhere onto my machine.
2. 'cd' into the directory where INSTALL.sh is.
3. If I'm not me then don't do the next step, since this .emacs probably only makes sense for me.
4. Run INSTALL.sh, taking care to understand it's going to nuke the .emacs and .emacs.d that's already there.

ISSUES
------

None at this time.
