INTRODUCTION 
------------

Just my personal .emacs and associated lisp packages. Since I switch
between computers and platforms a lot, I need an efficient way to
maintain my environment.

INSTALLATION 
------------

First time:

1. Mirror repo to ~/.emacs.d.
2. Copy .emacs inside repo to ~/.emacs. This file will always point to the "real" .emacs inside the .emacs.d directory.  

These next two are required to pull down the twilight theme submodule:

3. cd into repo.
4. Run 'git submodule init'.
5. Run 'git submodule update'.

Future times:

1. Pull repo in ~/.emacs.d from GitHub master.
2. Run 'git submodule update' as needed.

ISSUES 
------

Some built-in modes, e.g., python-mode, don't work under ntemacs.

TODO 
----

* Handle platform specific code better. Use cases:
** Code that will always be different depending on operating system. These should get their own file.
** Code that has to handle whether non-.emacs.d software (non-emacs apps) are installed (yet).
*** These should be documented along with instructions/pointers to installation processes.
*** When necessary 3rd party apps aren't installed, I should be notified at startup.
* Document process for setting up new system from soup to nuts.
** Should have a minimal path for when I just need to get stuff done on someone else's computer for a few hours.
** This includes, e.g., setting up GitHub config.
* File to quiz keyboard command katas.
* Need to enable SSH into home pc.
* Need to setup sync scripts on all my computers.
