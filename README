INTRODUCTION 
------------

Just my personal .emacs and associated lisp packages. Since I switch
between computers and platforms a lot, I need an efficient way to
maintain my environment.

INSTALLATION 
------------

First time:

1. Copy .emacs to ~/.emacs. This file will always point to the "real" .emacs inside the .emacs.d directory.  
2. Mirror repo to ~/.emacs.d.

Future times:

1. Pull repo in ~/.emacs.d from GitHub master.


ISSUES 
------

None.

TODO 
----

* Handle platform specific code better. Use cases:
** Code that will always be different depending on operating system. These should get their own file.
** Code that has to handle whether non-.emacs.d software (non-emacs apps) are installed (yet).
*** These should be documented along with instructions/pointers to installation processes.
*** When necessary 3rd party apps aren't installed, I should be notified at startup.
