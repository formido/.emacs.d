INTRODUCTION 
------------

Just my personal .emacs and associated lisp packages. Since I switch
between computers and platforms a lot, I need an efficient way to
maintain my environment.

INSTALLATION 
------------

First time:

1. Copy .emacs to ~/.emacs. This file will always point to the "real" .emacs inside the .emacs.d directory.  
2. Mirror repo to ~/.emacs.d.

Future times:

1. Pull repo in ~/.emacs.d from GitHub master.


ISSUES 
------

None.

TODO 
----

None.
